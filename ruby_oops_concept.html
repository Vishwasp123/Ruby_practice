<h2>Ruby OOPs Concept</h2>
<p>Ruby is a true object oriented language which can be embedded into Hypertext Markup Language. Everything in Ruby is an object. All the numbers, strings or even class is an object. The whole Ruby language is basically built on the concepts of object and data.

</p>
<p>OOPs is a programming concept that uses objects and their interactions to design applications and computer programs.</p>


<h3>Following are some basic concepts in OOPs:

Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Inheritance
Abstraction</h3>

<h4>Encapsulation:</h4>
<p>It hides the implementation details of a class from other objects due to which a class is unavailable to the rest of the code. Its main purpose is to protect data from data manipulation.</p>
<h4>Polymorphism:</h4>
<p>It is the ability to represent an operator or function in different ways for different data input.</p>
<h4>Inheritance:</h4>
<p>It creates new classes from pre defined classes. New class inherit behaviors of its parent class which is referred as superclass. In this way, pre defined classes can be made more reusable and useful</p>
<h4>Abstraction: </h4>
<p>It hides the complexity of a class by modelling classes appropriate to the problem.</p>
