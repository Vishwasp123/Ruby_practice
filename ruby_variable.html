Ruby Variable:-

Ruby variable are locations which hold data to be used in the programe.  

There are four types of variable in Ruby
1 Local Variable
2.Class Variable
3.instance Variable 
4.Global variable
5.Constant variable

Local Variable:- A local variable name starts with a lowercase letter or underscore (_). It is only accessible or have its scope within the block of its initialization. Once the code block completes, variable has no scope.
Class Variable:- A class variable name starts with @@ sign. They need to be initialized before use. A class variable belongs to the whole class and can be accessible from anywhere inside the class. If the value will be changed at one instance, it will be changed at every instance.

Instance variables:-
An instance variable name starts with a @ sign. It belongs to one instance of the class and can be accessed from any instance of the class within a method. They only have limited access to a particular instance of a class

Global variables:-
A global variable name starts with a $ sign. Its scope is globally, means it can be accessed from any where in a program.

An uninitialized global variable will have a nil value. It is advised not to use them as they make programs cryptic and complex.

There are a number of predefined global variables in Ruby.
