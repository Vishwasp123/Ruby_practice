<h3>Number</h3>
<p>Integers and floating point numbers come in the category of numbers</p>

<h3>Symbols</h3>
<p>Symbols are like strings. A symbol is preceded by a colon (:). For example, :abcd</p>
<p>They do not contain spaces. Symbols containing multiple words are written with (_). One difference between string and symbol is that, if text is a data then it is a string but if it is a code it is a symbol.

Symbols are unique identifiers and represent static values, while string represent values that change.</p>

<h3>Hashes</h3>
<p>A hash assign its values to its keys. They can be looked up by their keys. Value to a key is assigned by => sign. A key/value pair is separated with a comma between them and all the pairs are enclosed within curly braces. For example,

{"Akash" => "Physics", "Ankit" => "Chemistry", "Aman" => "Maths"}

<h3>Arrays</h3>
<p>An array stroes data or list of data. It can contain all types of data. Data in an array are separated by comma in between them and are enclosed by square bracket. For example:["Akash","Ankit","Aman"]
</p>
